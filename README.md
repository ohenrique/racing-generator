# Race Generator

:star: Star on GitHub — it motivates a lot!

Race Generator is an app developed using Expo. I utilized TypeScript and GraphQL to build it. 
I drew inspiration from this [screen](https://dribbble.com/shots/6923463-Sports-News-App) for the design, and I believe the result turned out well

## Installation

Before you begin, make sure you have everything necessary to run an Expo application. At a minimum, you’ll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/how-to-install-nodejs) if you want to run it on the web. However, if you prefer to run the app on Android, ensure that you have the [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/install) and entire [environment](https://developer.android.com/tools/variables) configured.

### Install dependencies

You can use any Node packager manager (Npm, Yarn, PNPM, Bun). In my example, I'm utilizing npm.

```npm install```

This will take a few minutes, after that you need just to run the application. In the same folder run the following command.

`npx expo start`

Through the console, choose the option that represents the platform you want to run Android or Web.

 `a`  or `w` 

## Run with the Expo Go App

You need first to download the Expo Go App, for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&referrer=www) or [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id982107779).
